A python model to extract all necessary elements such as text and images from a PDF file.

This model was built specifically for a company that needed to transform data from PDF into an excel for further. This task was done manually. To save time, a model was created that achieved the same result but faster. This was achieved by importing all necessary libraries in order to identify and read text in the PDF. Since, the excel had specific columns for certain details, text had to be processed on each page and saved in corresponding excel cells. Next, all images were read and saved separately with a user-friendly option to select location for the same. The only manual task was to insert the extracted and hence saved images into cells of the excel sheet.

Advantage- Setting up of the environment and running the code would take only 2-3 minutes, hence saving the time and effort of selecting, copying and pasting different text snippets as well as taking screenshots and cropping images to be saved in excel.

Diadvantage-Tha task of inserting images was still manual, changes in the code have to be made if PDF used is different.
